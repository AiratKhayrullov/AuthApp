## Description
This app was developed for a Mathematical Logic and Algorithm Theory Alternative Exam in the second year of study. 
It shows how we can use "Cellular automata" in real life. This application provides an authorization based on "Cellular automata". 

When we sign up for a profile instead of storing our password we hashing it and store it in the database(SQLite). 
When we sign in into our profile we compare out hashcode in the database with a new generated hashcode(based on the entered password)

## For what? For why? What next?
- The topic "Cellular automata" isn't completely researched nowadays. It might be helpful to next researchings.
- This system isn't safe but someone can enhance this system. We just show basic things that can we do with "Cellular automata"

## Example of working our app
Let's just create a profile and sign in to it.

## How it looks in the database?
